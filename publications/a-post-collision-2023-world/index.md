Collision 2023 has come to a close, and Floatcam was thrilled to be a part of it. We had an incredible time, meeting a host of amazing people who visited our booth. The feedback we received on our project was invaluable, and we're deeply grateful for it. Now back in Waterloo, we're diligently working on the next steps for Floatcam and will keep you updated on our progress.

## Why We Attended Collision 2023

Building anything worthwhile requires a multitude of perspectives. Collision presented an ideal platform for us to gather feedback on our project and explore the potential use cases people might envision. Initially, one of our goals was to raise pre-seed funding, but we pivoted towards primarily gathering feedback and gauging people's opinions of our product. We were delighted with the feedback we received and are now incorporating it into our next steps for Floatcam. The insights we gained from those who visited our booth were both encouraging and enlightening. While we're careful not to overfit our product based on this feedback, we're certainly taking it into account as we move forward.

For those unfamiliar with Floatcam, we are primarily a media collection tool. With Floatcam, you can effortlessly collect audio or video content from anyone, simply by using a link.

## What We Learned

Collision is a fantastic event for first-time founders, but we quickly realized it's not an event to attend alone. If you're an attendee, you'll find Collision useful for exploring the innovative work of numerous early-stage and growth startups. Think of it as a trade fair peppered with a variety of engaging talks. For startups planning to exhibit, remember that you can't do it alone. Assemble a team or enlist a friend to help you on the day of your exhibition. Try to collect people's emails if possible and follow up after the event.

In summary, it's crucial to have clear expectations for the event. If you plan to raise a round of funding, meeting with investors can be challenging, but not impossible. If your goal is to gain media exposure, be aware that media attendees tend to be the busiest group.

## What's Next for Floatcam

Our next step is to continue developing our MVP, with a planned launch in the first week of August.
