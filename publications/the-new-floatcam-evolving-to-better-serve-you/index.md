floatcam originated as a simple side project. I just wanted a customizable video widget to overlay on my screen recordings, and despite several paid services, none offered the exact solution I needed. Thus, I decided to build floatcam.

I built the first version of floatcam in 2021, but it wasn't until 2022 when I introduced it to the world on Product Hunt that it truly started to take shape. To my surprise, there were people looking for a solution just like this - a simple way to enhance their screen recordings. This positive feedback led me to make floatcam open-source, and share it on GitHub.

## A Change of Course

Despite the positive reception of floatcam, I initially wasn't passionate about the project, as it seemed too straightforward. I was concurrently working on a document automation software, WriteOnce, which I thought would garner more traction. However, financial pressures led me to concentrate solely on floatcam.

This refocusing sparked new ideas: How could I broaden floatcam's appeal? The answer lay in simplifying video collection for users and introducing AI capabilities to this process. I noticed that many AI models were hard to get started with, due to the extensive documentation and steps involved. I wanted to make it easy for anyone to use AI without getting lost in technicalities, and so, the new floatcam was born.

## What's New with floatcam?

floatcam has evolved into a comprehensive media collection tool that integrates AI into the capture process. Let's break this down:

1. Media Collection: At its core, floatcam collects videos, audio, and images from your audience. This functionality is invaluable for educators, journalists, researchers, content creators, and many others who need to gather media content easily.
2. AI Capabilities: floatcam now offers AI models for real-time transcription, face matching, detection and recognition, sentiment analysis, video and audio search, and more. It takes considerable time and resources to build and deploy a media capture system infused with AI capabilities. floatcam takes care of all of this, making it straightforward to incorporate AI into your media collection process.

## How Does floatcam Work?

For non-technical users, media capture is facilitated through a recording link created on floatcam. Once the link is set up with the necessary parameters, it's shared with the desired parties who can leave a recording without needing to install any software. All recordings are sent to floatcam for real-time processing and then made available for download or further processing.

For developers, integrating floatcam into your software to collect video from users is a breeze. With a few lines of code, you can create and customize our widget, enabling easy media collection.
